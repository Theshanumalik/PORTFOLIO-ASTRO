## What is Astro?

Astro is a static site generator that is designed to be fast and easy to use. It is built with modern web technologies like React and TypeScript, and it is designed to be highly performant. Astro is designed to be a modern alternative to traditional static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo, and it is designed to be highly flexible and extensible.

## Getting Started

To get started with Astro, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website and follow the installation instructions. Once you have Node.js installed, you can create a new Astro project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-astro
```

This will create a new Astro project in the current directory and install all of the necessary dependencies. Once the project has been created, you can navigate to the project directory and start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your default web browser to the Astro project. You can now start building your static site with Astro!

## Building Your Site

Astro uses a file-based routing system, which means that each page in your site is represented by a file in the `src/pages` directory. You can create a new page in your site by creating a new file in the `src/pages` directory with the `.astro` extension. For example, to create a new page called `about`, you would create a new file called `about.astro` in the `src/pages` directory.

Astro also supports layouts, which allow you to define a common layout for all of the pages in your site. You can create a new layout in the `src/layouts` directory by creating a new file with the `.astro` extension. For example, to create a new layout called `default`, you would create a new file called `default.astro` in the `src/layouts` directory.
